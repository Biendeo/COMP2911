## COMP2911 Project
This is our project for 2911. Make sure you check the issues for things you need to do, or things you want done.

### Downloading the project
* Download the eGit plugin in your Eclipse, and restart.
* Go to File -> Import -> Git -> Projects From Git -> Clone URI, then put in https://github.com/Biendeo/COMP2911.git and import the Eclipse project in.

### Updating the project
* Firstly, right click the project and go Team -> Pull. You always want the latest version.
* Do your stuff.
* When you've done your changes, right click the project and go Team -> Commit (or Ctrl + #). Leave a nice message, and commit and push. It may ask you for your Github details.
* Please don't leave errors for other people. Comment your stuff out, and mark it as an issue if you're having compile errors and you can't fix it.

### Requesting features
* Each group will be working on a specific part of the project (eg. back-end generation, or front-end UI), and sometimes you'll want something from another group.
* Create an issue on the issue tab, describe your request, and give it an appropriate label. 
  * **Bug** is for parts that don't work the way you want.
  * **Chore** is for something really boring like refactoring code or adding documentation.
  * **Design** is mostly for starting things from scratch (although it can be for minor algorithm design too).
  * **Discussion** is just for talking about something with no real programming goal.
  * **Duplicate** is purely for requests that have been asked already.
  * **Enhancement** is for extending something that exists already.
  * **Feature** is for creating a new part of the program (like a function request). If you want a new function in another class, just create that function with a dummy return to keep your code working.
  * **Help wanted** is for existing issues that need additional assistance.
  * **In progress** is just to mark things that are currently being worked on. Only the assignee should be marking this.
  * **Invalid** is for features that can't be fulfilled.
  * **On hold** is for requests that can't be finished just now. They should be resumed to meet the deadlines though.
  * **Optimisation** is for tweaking something so it runs faster.
  * **Question** is purely for asking something with no programming expected.
  * **Test** can be for either writing tests, or experimenting certain features.
  * **Won't fix** are for enhancements that won't be fulfilled.
* If someone wants to solve and issue, they should mark themselves as the assignee. If they're working on it, they should tag it with **In progress** to inform everyone that it's underway.
* When an issue has been solved, close it as soon as you've pushed it. It'll tell everyone that it's done.

### Roadmap
The project will be done from week 7 to week 12 (due Friday 27th May). Assignment 2 is due week 9, so progress will be a bit slower in the first three weeks. Each week has been listed as a milestone, and issues will be assigned to each week, depending on how important it is, or how easy it is to create.
